#The repo consist of some of the very popular questions of SPOJ and HackerEarth. 

The questions are well categorised and picked in the sequence of a popular course of coding ninjas (https://codingninjas.in/)

I solved the questions accordingly and the solutions are capable of passing all the testcases that i think of. 

This repo is for those who wants to start their coding days in a sequential order by grasping all the concepts orderly. However it is mandatory for them to have a good knowledge of c++ or Python syntax.

The order to follow the modules are listed:
